### Aim
Create a Box critters private server engine for people to freely make their own servers

### Things used
- [boxcritters.org](https://boxcritters.org) - We used boxcritters.org as the first client and built the server from scratch using any socket information we could get from the client script.
- [boxcritters.com/play](https://boxcritters.com/play) - Later in development boxcritters.com was used as the intended client, with the help of a userscript to connect to the server.

### Outcomes
- The creation of this aided the development of [[Project: Critality]]
- The [boxcritters.org](https://boxcritters.org) client was used in the creation of [[Project:LearnToCode]].
